# FAQ

## Find research

### The publication I want to read does not have a full text link. How can I get access?
You can contact your local public library, who can get you a copy. 

### My search gets too many results for me to handle
Try to limit your search by using the filters on the left, for example you could look at publications from a certain year, or search in one SDG at a time. If you use "SDG Action" to limit by SDG, you will get fewer results than if you use "SDG Topic". 

### My search gets hardly any results
Sometimes the problem can be that you have spelled your search terms incorrectly. You can also try a new search with a more general search term, try a different synonym. If you have searched with Norwegian search terms, you can try and search in English. You can also check which filters you have used - are there some you could widen? If you have limited to a certain SDG using the "SDG Action" filter, try using "SDG Topic" instead. 

### What are "targets"?
Each of the SDGs consists of several more detailed targets. You can read more about these under About the SDGs [LENKE]. 

### What is the difference between "SDG Topic" and "SDG Action"?
We map publications using two approaches, which differ in how closely related research has to be to the SDGs to be included. "SDG Action" includes fewer results that "SDG Topic". You can read more about these under [Methods & Coverage].

### Why can't I find a specific publication?
The publication has to be indexed in CRISTIN with a publication date from 2015 to be included in this service. The title/abstract/keywords also have to include terms that allow it to be mapped as "SDG-relevant" by our mapping. You can read more under [About this service,Coverage].

### Why can I see some results that look irrelevant?
Some irrelevant results will likely make it into the service because mapping via search strings (our method) is not 100 % reliable. If you are finding this problematic, you can choose to filter using "SDG Action" (a narrower definition of relevance) instead of "SDG Topic" (broader). If you would like to give us feedback about something that does not look right/irrelevant results, please [contact us].

### Can I see results that are relevant to multiple SDGs?
In the filter options to the left, choose two or more SDGs (either using "SDG Topic" or "SDG Action", dependent on whether you want a broader or narrower set of results). The results will show publications which are mapped to the SDGs you have chosen. 


## Search strings in Web of Science

### Can I use these strings in other databases, such as Scopus?
You are welcome to use them in other databases, but you will have to edit them to ensure that they work correctly. For example, the symbols for truncation might be different. Check the documentation for the database you wish to use. You may also be able to find guides online about how to convert search string syntax between databases. 

### How were the search strings/mappings developed?
You can find information about this here: [link to methods under about this service]


## Statistics

Statistics about SDG research in Norway are under development, and will be published after the dataset is complete (estimated early 2023). 


## About this service

### Which SDGs do you cover?
We currently cover 9 SDGs (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, with SDG 12 under development). More can be added to the service, depending on our capacity. 

### What do you consider SDG-"relevant"? How did you decide which publciations to cover?
We consider research publications "relevant" if we can relate them to one of the SDG targets. You can read more about our interpretation and method under [About this service].

### How have you found these publications? 
Our methods are described under [About].
