# Statistics about SDG-related research from institutions

Here you can find statistics about SDG-related scientific publications from various institutions in Norway. 
You can choose sector and instituion from the drop-down menus in the visualisations. 

Only institutions from the higher education, health and institute sectors are included. Research works are also produced by other actors, for example
businesses or public management, but this research is not as thoroughly documented within our data sources - it is more likely to be incomplete and unstandardised,
and is therefore not included. The statistics are based on "scientific" works only, as defined by the Norwegian Publishing Indicator 
([read more about how "scientific" is defined here](/en/hjelp/sokehjelp#scientific-nvi)).
