# Statistics

These pages provide statistics about research publications related to the sustainable development goals, 
both at a [national level (Norway)](/en/statistikk/nasjonal-statistikk) and [institutional level](/en/statistikk/aktorer-statistikk).
The statistics are based on the broadest mapping of publications; see [About this service - Mapping methodology](/en/om/om-tjenesten#sdg-mapping-methodology) for informasjon.
