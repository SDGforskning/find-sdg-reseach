# Search guide

## Searching
* Searches are carried out in the title of the results – a result with show up if it has a word in the title that matches your search term
* If you search with multiple search terms, for example “wind power”, the first results you will see are those which contain both terms in the title. Then, as you move down the results list and there are no more that contain both terms, you will start to see results that contain just one of the terms. 
* Searching for partial words will match several possible full words, when searching with **one** search term. For example, searching for "fisher" will show you results with "fisher", "fisheries" or "fishery" in the title. However, searching for "fisher cod" (two search terms) will only find results containing "fisher" (or "cod").
* The search is not multilingual – if you search with a Norwegian term, you will get results with that Norwegian word in the title. For example, a search with the Norwegian term “fattigdom” will not find English works with “poverty” in the title (or vice versa).  

## Filters
### Fulltext found
If we have identified a URL which we expect to give open access to the full text. This is based on data from Unpaywall, DOAJ and CRISTIN.
### Scientific (NVI) 
If the publication is considered “scientific” according to the criteria in NVI (Norsk Vitenskapsindex), which can be read on the [Norsk Publiseringsindikator webpages](https://npi.hkdir.no/informasjon#definisjoner). This includes that the journal/publisher should have procedures for peer review. Works that are "scientific" will also have a "NVI level": The level is based on which channel (journal or publisher) the publication was published by. You can read more about NVI levels on the [Norsk Publiseringsindikator webpages](https://npi.hkdir.no/informasjon#nivaainndeling).
### Language
Language the publication is written in.
### Mentions
If we have found that the publication mentions either Norway or the SDGs themselves. For example, a publication titled “Improving education in an Oslo school” would count as mentioning Norway; one titled “SDG 3: Where to next?” would count as mentioning the SDGs.
### SDG Topic, SDG Topic Targets
This is where you can filter publications related to certain SDGs and SDG targets, using the “topic” approach. The topic approach finds a wide set of results that mention topics in the SDG targets (e.g. “hunger”). Use this (rather than “SDG action”) if you want a wider set of results. See [About this service](/om/om-tjenesten) for more information.
### SDG Action, SDG Action Targets
This is the mapping of publications to SDGs and SDG targets, using the “action” approach. The action approach finds a narrower set of results that mention actions in the SDG targets (e.g. “end hunger”). Use this (rather than “SDG topic”) if you want a smaller set of results. See [About this service](/om/om-tjenesten) for more information.

### Scientific field (NPI)

The channels in each field can be browsed on the [Norsk Publiseringsindikator webpages](https://npi.hkdir.no/fagfeltoversikt).
