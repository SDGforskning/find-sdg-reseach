# Search guide

## Searching
* Searches are carried out in the title of the results – a result with show up if it has a word in the title that matches your search term
* Searching for partial words will match full words. For example, searching for “child” will also show you results with “children” in the title. 
* If you search with multiple search terms, for example “wind power”, the first results you will see are those which contain both terms in the title. Then, as you move down the results list and there are no more that contain both terms, you will start to see results that contain just one of the terms. 
* The search is not multilingual – if you search with a Norwegian term, you will get results with that Norwegian word in the title. For example, a search with the Norwegian term “fattigdom” will not find English works with “poverty” in the title (or vice versa).  
## Filters

### SDG Topic and Topic, targets
This is where you can filter publications related to certain SDGs and SDG targets, using the “topic” approach. The topic approach finds a wide set of results that mention topics in the SDG targets (e.g. “hunger”). Use this (rather than “SDG action”) if you want a wider set of results. See [About this service](/om/om-tjenesten) for more information.
### SDG Action and Action, targets 
This is the mapping of publications to SDGs and SDG targets, using the “action” approach.
