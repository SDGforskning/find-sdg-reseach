# Search

Find publications from Norway related to the Sustainable Development Goals. Currently the website is a **beta version (under development)**. We cover works published from 2015 to mid-2022; more recent works will be added in 2023.

* Search tip 1: Search using English or Norwegian terms - but searches are not translated, so search in both languages to get more results.
* Search tip 2: Filter using "SDG - topic" to get results related to a specific SDG; if you need to narrow down your search further, consider using 
the "SDG topic, targets" filter (to limit to a target area under the SDG), or use the "SDG action" filter (to limit to works related to action).

If you need help, take a look at [Search tips](/hjelp/sokehjelp), [FAQ](/hjelp/ofte-stilte-sporsmal), or [About this service](/om/om-tjenesten).
